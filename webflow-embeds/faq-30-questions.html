      <summary>Is SMB Voice VoIP or landline?</summary>
      <div class="smb-faq-30-answer">SMB Voice is VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), meaning calls travel over the internet rather than traditional phone lines. This enables lower costs, more features, and device flexibility. VoIP quality equals or exceeds landline quality with a good internet connection.</div>
    </details>

    <details class="smb-faq-30-item">
      <summary>What internet speed do I need for VoIP?</summary>
      <div class="smb-faq-30-answer">SMB Voice requires minimal bandwidth - about 100 Kbps per call. Most home and business internet connections easily support this. For best quality, we recommend at least 1 Mbps upload speed. WiFi, cellular data (4G/5G), and wired ethernet all work well.</div>
    </details>

    <details class="smb-faq-30-item">
      <summary>What happens if I lose internet connection?</summary>
